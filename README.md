- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr. Daryl R. Brydie and my Handle is: @drbrydie
- 👀 Being as though I am a mathematician (i.e. Numerical Analysis/Scientific Computing) by training, I have always been interested in the study of algorthms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis...vis-à-vis the study of numerical methods that attempt at finding approximate solutions to problems rather than exact ones.
- 🌱 As such, I’m currently applying my knowledge in the area of Cybersecurity...specifically implementations of Artifical Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) toward the task of forwarding the efficacy of Lattice-based Cryptography, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Threat Hunting, Red/Blue/Purple Teams, and Penetration Testing - using primarily Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with applied mathematics/cybersecurity researchers and tacticians with similar interests.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (TBD)
